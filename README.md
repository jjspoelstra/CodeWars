# Codewars
My repository of codewars challenges, push anywhere from 14-21 solutions every week.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: JavaScript

Every day, the first thing I work on is two or three codewars.


# Lessons Learned:
It is okay not to know things at first. When this is the case, it is a great opportunity to expand my knowledge and become a better programmer.
